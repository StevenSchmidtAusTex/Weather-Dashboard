## Overview

The Weather Dashboard takes a location entered by the user and provides both current weather, and a 5-day forecast.

## Development

Weather Dashboard used [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) to call weather data and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to translate user input into latitude and longitude.

For future development, I'd like to clean up the interface as well as make it responsive for smaller screens.
